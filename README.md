# Hi, I'm Deborah 🐝

I'm a multitasking wizard, warden of annotation, keeper of data standards, protector of data quality, and mother of documentation.

Jokes aside, here are some of my activities:

I contribute to the development of the OneDep deposition and annotation system at the [wwPDB](https://github.com/wwPDB).

I develop tools for handling and validating mmCIF/PDBx structural data formats to improve interoperability and data quality across the ecosystem, including the [wwpdb-ccp4-ccd-comparison](https://github.com/deborahharrus/wwpdb-ccp4-ccd-comparison) project.

I maintain [tiny_tools](https://github.com/deborahharrus/tiny_tools): small, focused Python utilities built for simplicity and reusability.

I also contribute to data curation and quality efforts for [ChEBI](https://github.com/ebi-chebi/ChEBI).
